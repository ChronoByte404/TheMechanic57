# About-me

I'm 17 years old.

I am interested in AI, Home Automation Systems, Natural Language UIs, GUI programming and all manner of Python programming.

# Programs I've made.

I have programmed a home automation voice-controlled python program in the past, which was recently combined with an open source Intent Classification program.
I have programmed a web browser UI with PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine.
And some more small insignificant programs.
